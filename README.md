## About

Snake Game - This project is an extension of a Javascript class by teacher Gabriela Pinheiro from the DIO platform, Digital Innovation One.
I took her class as a starting point, made some additions, like changing the style of the page, added a score to the game, so now when the snake eats a "strawberry" the score goes up. Also i made a button to start the game and when you lose I added a button to restart it.

## How it works

This project is uses the basic frontend:
1. Javascript 
2. HTML 
3. CSS (for style the page and the game)

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tool installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). 
In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


#### Running the web application (Frontend)

# Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com: brunochaves77 / snakegame.git

# Access the project folder in your terminal
$ cd snakegame

# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the application in development mode
$ npm run start

# The application will open on the port: 3000 - go to http://localhost:3000
